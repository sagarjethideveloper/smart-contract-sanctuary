   * Lending pool smart contracts
   * -----------------------------
   * Each ERC20 token has an individual pool which users provide their liquidity to the pool.
   * Users can use their liquidity as collateral to borrow any asset from all pools if their account is still healthy.
   * By account health checking, the total borrow value must less than the total collateral value (collateral value is
   * ~75% of the liquidity value depends on each token). Borrower need to repay the loan with accumulated interest.
   * Liquidity provider would receive the borrow interest. In case of the user account is not healthy
   * then liquidator can help to liquidate the user's account then receive the collateral with liquidation bonus as the reward.
   *
   * The status of the pool
   * -----------------------------
   * The pool has 3 status. every pool will have only one status at a time.
   * 1. INACTIVE - the pool is on initialized state or inactive state so it's not ready for user to do any actions. users can't deposit, borrow,
   * repay and withdraw
   * 2 .ACTIVE - the pool is active. users can deposit, borrow, repay, withdraw and liquidate
   * 3. CLOSED - the pool is waiting for inactive state. users can clear their account by repaying, withdrawal, liquidation but can't deposit, borrow
