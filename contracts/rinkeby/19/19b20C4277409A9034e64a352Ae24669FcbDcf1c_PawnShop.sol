// @title  Main contract for NFTfi. This contract manages the ability to create
//         NFT-backed peer-to-peer loans.
// @author smartcontractdev.eth, creator of wrappedkitties.eth, cwhelper.eth, and
//         kittybounties.eth
// @notice There are five steps needed to commence an NFT-backed loan. First,
//         the borrower calls nftContract.approveAll(NFTfi), approving the NFTfi
//         contract to move their NFT's on their behalf. Second, the borrower
//         signs an off-chain message for each NFT that they would like to
//         put up for collateral. This prevents borrowers from accidentally
//         lending an NFT that they didn't mean to lend, due to approveAll()
//         approving their entire collection. Third, the lender calls
//         erc20Contract.approve(NFTfi), allowing NFTfi to move the lender's
//         ERC20 tokens on their behalf. Fourth, the lender signs an off-chain
//         message, proposing the amount, rate, and duration of a loan for a
//         particular NFT. Fifth, the borrower calls NFTfi.beginLoan() to
//         accept these terms and enter into the loan. The NFT is stored in the
//         contract, the borrower receives the loan principal in the specified
//         ERC20 currency, and the lender receives an NFTfi promissory note (in
//         ERC721 form) that represents the rights to either the
//         principal-plus-interest, or the underlying NFT collateral if the
//         borrower does not pay back in time. The lender can freely transfer
//         and trade this ERC721 promissory note as they wish, with the
//         knowledge that transferring the ERC721 promissory note tranfsers the
//         rights to principal-plus-interest and/or collateral, and that they
//         will no longer have a claim on the loan. The ERC721 promissory note
//         itself represents that claim.
// @notice A loan may end in one of two ways. First, a borrower may call
//         NFTfi.payBackLoan() and pay back the loan plus interest at any time,
//         in which case they receive their NFT back in the same transaction.
//         Second, if the loan's duration has passed and the loan has not been
//         paid back yet, a lender can call NFTfi.liquidateOverdueLoan(), in
//         which case they receive the underlying NFT collateral and forfeit
//         the rights to the principal-plus-interest, which the borrower now
//         keeps.
// @notice If the loan was agreed to be a pro-rata interest loan, then the user
//         only pays the principal plus pro-rata interest if repaid early.
//         However, if the loan was agreed to be a fixed-repayment loan (by
//         specifying UINT32_MAX as the value for
//         loanInterestRateForDurationInBasisPoints), then the borrower pays
//         the maximumRepaymentAmount regardless of whether they repay early
//         or not.

    // @notice This function is called by a borrower when they want to commence
    //         a loan, but can only be called after first: (1) the borrower has
    //         called approve() or approveAll() on the NFT contract for the NFT
    //         that will be used as collateral, (2) the borrower has signed an
    //         off-chain message indicating that they are willing to use this
    //         NFT as collateral, (3) the lender has called approve() on the
    //         ERC20 contract of the principal, and (4) the lender has signed
    //         an off-chain message agreeing to the terms of this loan supplied
    //         in this transaction.
    // @notice Note that a user may submit UINT32_MAX as the value for
    //         _loanInterestRateForDurationInBasisPoints to indicate that they
    //         wish to take out a fixed-repayment loan, where the interest is
    //         not pro-rated if repaid early.
    // @param  _loanPrincipalAmount - The original sum of money transferred
    //         from lender to borrower at the beginning of the loan, measured
    //         in loanERC20Denomination's smallest units.
    // @param  _maximumRepaymentAmount - The maximum amount of money that the
    //         borrower would be required to retrieve their collateral,
    //         measured in the smallest units of the ERC20 currency used for
    //         the loan. If interestIsProRated is set to false (by submitting
    //         a value of UINT32_MAX for
    //         _loanInterestRateForDurationInBasisPoints), then the borrower
    //         will always have to pay this amount to retrieve their
    //         collateral, regardless of whether they repay early.
    // @param  _nftCollateralId - The ID within the NFTCollateralContract for
    //         the NFT being used as collateral for this loan. The NFT is
    //         stored within this contract during the duration of the loan.
    // @param  _loanDuration - The amount of time (measured in seconds) that can
    //         elapse before the lender can liquidate the loan and seize the
    //         underlying collateral NFT.
    // @param  _loanInterestRateForDurationInBasisPoints - The interest rate
    //         (measured in basis points, e.g. hundreths of a percent) for the
    //         loan, that must be repaid pro-rata by the borrower at the
    //         conclusion of the loan or risk seizure of their nft collateral.
    //         However, a user may submit UINT32_MAX as the value for
    //         _loanInterestRateForDurationInBasisPoints to indicate that they
    //         wish to take out a fixed-repayment loan, where the interest is
    //         not pro-rated if repaid early. Instead, maximumRepaymentAmount
    //         will always be the amount to be repaid.
    // @param  _adminFeeInBasisPoints - The percent (measured in basis
    //         points) of the interest earned that will be taken as a fee by
    //         the contract admins when the loan is repaid. The fee is stored
    //         in the loan struct to prevent an attack where the contract
    //         admins could adjust the fee right before a loan is repaid, and
    //         take all of the interest earned.
    // @param  _borrowerAndLenderNonces - An array of two UINT256 values, the
    //         first of which is the _borrowerNonce and the second of which is
    //         the _lenderNonce. The nonces referred to here are not the same
    //         as an Ethereum account's nonce. We are referring instead to
    //         nonces that are used by both the lender and the borrower when
    //         they are first signing off-chain NFTfi orders. These nonces can
    //         be any uint256 value that the user has not previously used to
    //         sign an off-chain order. Each nonce can be used at most once per
    //         user within NFTfi, regardless of whether they are the lender or
    //         the borrower in that situation. This serves two purposes. First,
    //         it prevents replay attacks where an attacker would submit a
    //         user's off-chain order more than once. Second, it allows a user
    //         to cancel an off-chain order by calling
    //         NFTfi.cancelLoanCommitmentBeforeLoanHasBegun(), which marks the
    //         nonce as used and prevents any future loan from using the user's
    //         off-chain order that contains that nonce.
    // @param  _nftCollateralContract - The address of the ERC721 contract of
    //         the NFT collateral.
    // @param  _loanERC20Denomination - The address of the ERC20 contract of
    //         the currency being used as principal/interest for this loan.
    // @param  _lender - The address of the lender. The lender can change their
    //         address by transferring the NFTfi ERC721 token that they
    //         received when the loan began.
    // @param  _borrowerSignature - The ECDSA signature of the borrower,
    //         obtained off-chain ahead of time, signing the following
    //         combination of parameters: _nftCollateralId, _borrowerNonce,
    //         _nftCollateralContract, _borrower.
    // @param  _lenderSignature - The ECDSA signature of the lender,
    //         obtained off-chain ahead of time, signing the following
    //         combination of parameters: _loanPrincipalAmount,
