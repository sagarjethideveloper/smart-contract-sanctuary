///         1. Route Auction: User broadcasts to our network signalling their 
///         desired route. Routers respond with sealed bids containing 
///         commitments to fulfilling the transaction within a certain time and 
///         price range.
///
///         2. Prepare: Once the auction is completed, the transaction can be 
///         prepared. The user submits a transaction to `TransactionManager` 
///         contract on sender-side chain containing router's signed bid. This 
///         transaction locks up the users funds on the sending chiain. Upon 
///         detecting an event containing their signed bid from the chain, 
///         router submits the same transaction to `TransactionManager` on the 
///         receiver-side chain, and locks up a corresponding amount of 
///         liquidity. The amount locked on the receiving chain is `sending 
///         amount - auction fee` so the router is incentivized to complete the 
///         transaction.
///
///         3. Fulfill: Upon detecting the `TransactionPrepared` event on the 
///         receiver-side chain, the user signs a message and sends it to a 
///         relayer, who will earn a fee for submission. The relayer (which may 
///         be the router) then submits the message to the `TransactionManager` 
///         to complete their transaction on receiver-side chain and claim the 
///         funds locked by the router. A relayer is used here to allow users 
///         to submit transactions with arbitrary calldata on the receiving 
///         chain without needing gas to do so. The router then submits the 
///         same signed message and completes transaction on sender-side, 
///         unlocking the original `amount`.
