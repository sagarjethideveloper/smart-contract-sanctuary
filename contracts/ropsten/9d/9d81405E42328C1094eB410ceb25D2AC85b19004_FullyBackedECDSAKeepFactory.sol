  // by expanding into the preallocated memory.
  //
  // When we run out of preallocated memory when trying to `push`,
  // we allocate twice as much and copy the array over.
  // With linear allocation costs this would amortize to O(1)
  // but with EVM allocations being actually quadratic
  // the real performance is a very technical O(N).
  // Nonetheless, this is reasonably performant in practice.
  //
  // A dynamic array can be useful
  // even when you aren't dealing with an unknown number of items.
  // Because the array tracks the allocated space
  // separately from the number of stored items,
  // you can push items into the dynamic array
  // and iterate over the currently present items
  // without tracking their number yourself,
  // or using a special null value for empty elements.
  //
  // Because Solidity doesn't really have useful safety features,
  // only enough superficial inconveniences
  // to lull yourself into a false sense of security,
  // dynamic arrays require a bit of care to handle appropriately.
  //
  // First of all,
  // dynamic arrays must not be created or modified manually.
  // Use `uintArray(length)`, or `convert(existingArray)`
  // which will perform a safe and efficient conversion for you.
  // This also applies to storage;
  // in-memory dynamic arrays are for efficient in-memory operations only,
  // and it is unnecessary to store dynamic arrays.
  // Use a regular `uint256[]` instead.
  // The contents of `array` may be written like `dynamicArray.array[i] = x`
  // but never reassign the `array` pointer itself
  // nor mess with `allocatedMemory` in any way whatsoever.
  // If you fail to follow these precautions,
  // dragons inhabiting the no-man's-land
  // between the array as it's seen by Solidity
  // and the next thing allocated after it
  // will be unleashed to wreak havoc upon your memory buffers.
  //
  // Second,
  // because the `array` may be reassigned when pushing,
  // the following pattern is unsafe:
  // ```
  // UintArray dynamicArray;
  // uint256 len = dynamicArray.array.length;
  // uint256[] danglingPointer = dynamicArray.array;
  // danglingPointer[0] = x;
  // dynamicArray.push(y);
  // danglingPointer[0] = z;
  // uint256 surprise = danglingPointer[len];
  // ```
  // After the above code block,
  // `dynamicArray.array[0]` may be either `x` or `z`,
  // and `surprise` may be `y` or out of bounds.
  // This will not share your address space with a malevolent agent of chaos,
  // but it will cause entirely avoidable scratchings of the head.
  //
  // Dynamic arrays should be safe to use like ordinary arrays
  // if you always refer to the array field of the dynamic array
  // when reading or writing values:
  // ```
  // UintArray dynamicArray;
  // uint256 len = dynamicArray.array.length;
  // dynamicArray.array[0] = x;
  // dynamicArray.push(y);
