/*
 * @title Token pools that allows different ERC20 tokens and ETH deposits and withdrawals
 * with penalty and bonus mechanisms to encaurage long term holding. 
 * Each token has one independent pool. i.e. all accounting is separate for each token.
 * @author artdgn (@github)
 * @notice The mechanism rules:
 * - A depositor is committing for the "commitment period", after which the
 *   deposit can be withdrawn with its share of the bonus pool.
 * - Bonus pool is populated from the penalties for early withdrawals,
 *   which are withdrawals done before each deposit's commitment period is elapsed.
 * - The share of the bonus pool is equal to the share of the deposit from all deposits
 *   at the time of withdrawal.
 * - Withdrawal before commitment period is not entitled to any part of the bonus
 *   and is instead "slashed" with a penalty (that is added to the bonus pool).
 * - The penalty percent is decreasing linearly from 
 *   initialPenaltyPercent to 0 with time (for the duration of the commitPeriod). 
 * - Any additional deposit is added to the current deposit and "resets" the
 *   commitment period required to wait.
 * @dev For safety and clarity, the withdrawal functionality is split into 
 * two methods, one for withdrawing with penalty, and the other one for withdrawing
 * with bonus.
 * Also, the ERC20 token and ETH functionality is split into separate methods.
 * The total deposits amount is tracked per token contract in 
 * depositSums, bonuses in bonusSums.
