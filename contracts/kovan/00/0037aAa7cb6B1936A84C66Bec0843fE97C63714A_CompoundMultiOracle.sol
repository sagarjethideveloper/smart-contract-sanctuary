/**
 * @dev Contract module that allows children to implement role-based access
 * control mechanisms.
 *
 * Roles are referred to by their `bytes4` identifier. These are expected to be the 
 * signatures for all the functions in the contract. Special roles should be exposed
 * in the external API and be unique:
 *
 * ```
 * bytes4 public constant ROOT = 0x00000000;
 * ```
 *
 * Roles represent restricted access to a function call. For that purpose, use {auth}:
 *
 * ```
 * function foo() public auth {
 *     ...
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Roles can be granted and revoked dynamically via the {grantRole} and
 * {revokeRole} functions. Each role has an associated admin role, and only
 * accounts that have a role's admin role can call {grantRole} and {revokeRole}.
 *
 * By default, the admin role for all roles is `ROOT`, which means
 * that only accounts with this role will be able to grant or revoke other
 * roles. More complex role relationships can be created by using
 * {setRoleAdmin}.
 *
 * WARNING: The `ROOT` is also its own admin: it has permission to
 * grant and revoke this role. Extra precautions should be taken to secure
 * accounts that have been granted it.
