 * @title PaymentSplitter
 * @dev This contract allows split Token payments among a group of accounts. The sender does not need to be aware
 * that the Tokens will be split in this way, since it is handled transparently by the contract.
 *
 * The split can be in equal parts or in any other arbitrary proportion. The way this is specified is by assigning each
 * account to a number of shares. Of all the Tokens that this contract receives, each account will then be able to claim
 * an amount proportional to the percentage of total shares they were assigned.
 *
 * `PaymentSplitter` follows a _pull payment_ model. This means that payments are not automatically forwarded to the
 * accounts but kept in this contract, and the actual transfer is triggered as a separate step by calling the {release}
 * function.
